 @param willLeave YES if another application will be launched to execute the action; NO if the action is going to be executed inside your appliaction.
 
 @return Your delegate returns YES if the native ad action should execute; NO to prevent the native ad action from executing.
 
 This method is called when the user taps the native ad. Your application controls whether the action is triggered. To allow the action to be triggered,
 return YES. To suppress the action, return NO. Your application should almost always allow actions to be triggered; preventing actions may alter the
 advertisements your application sees and reduce the revenue your application earns through TapIt! by Phunware.
 
 If the willLeave parameter is YES, then your application is moved to the background shortly after this method returns. In this situation, your method
 implementation does not need to perform additional work. If willLeave is set to NO, then the triggered action will cover your application’s user
 interface to show the advertising action. Although your application continues to run normally, your implementation of this method should disable
 activities that require user interaction while the action is executing. For example, a game might pause its game play until the user finishes
 watching the advertisement.
